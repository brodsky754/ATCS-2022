       <p class="paragraph">My name is Nate Goldberg. I am a senior in highschool and go to Menlo School. I have 4 siblings: Sasha, Hannah, Teddy, and Melanie. I also have a mom and stepdad.
       Throughout my years in highschool, I have done a lot, which can be seen on my <a href="file:///Users/ngoldberg/Documents/ATCS/ATCS-2022/portfolio/experience.html">experience page</a> and ranges from internships to sports to service work.
       I am stem focused student. I have taken many challenging stem related courses and hope to continue to do so at college.
       My main passions are sports, friends/family, and math. The main sports I follow intensely are basketball and football as I am die hard fan of the Minnesota Vikings and Golden State Warriors.
       I am a very social person and would be happy to connect with anyone which can be done on my <a href="file:///Users/ngoldberg/Documents/ATCS/ATCS-2022/portfolio/contact.html">contact me</a> page or go back to <a href="file:///Users/ngoldberg/Documents/ATCS/ATCS-2022/portfolio/index.html">main page</a>.
       Finally, I have made an incredible community of friends which can be seen below.</p>
