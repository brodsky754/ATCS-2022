       <p>My name is Nate Goldberg. I am a senior in highschool and go to Menlo School. I have 4 siblings: Sasha, Hannah, Teddy, and Melanie. I also have a mom and stepdad.</p>
       <p>Throughout my years in highschool, I have done a lot, which can be seen on my <a href="file:///Users/ngoldberg/Documents/ATCS/ATCS-2022/portfolio/experience.html">experience page</a> and ranges from internships to sports.</p>
       <p>My main passions are sports, friends/family, and math. The main sports I follow intensely are basketball and football as I am die hard fan of the Minnesota Vikings and Golden State Warriors.</p>
       <p>I also consider my self a very social person and would be happy to connect with anyone which can be done on my <a href="file:///Users/ngoldberg/Documents/ATCS/ATCS-2022/portfolio/contact.html">contact me</a> page.</p>
